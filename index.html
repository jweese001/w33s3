                    When I co-founded Bioscape Digital in 2013, I saw healthcare struggling with a fundamental problem: patients were disconnected from their care experience, sitting in hospital beds with no way to understand their treatment or communicate effectively with their care teams. We built a tablet-based, bedside solution that integrates text, audio and 3D visual imagery into an intuitive touch screen experience, allowing providers to overcome language and education barriers. Over 11 years, I architected and scaled the CarePrime platform from a startup concept to an enterprise solution now serving 140+ healthcare facilities, transforming how patients engage with their healthcare journey at the most critical moment: the point of care.

                    The challenge was immense: how do you build technology that works seamlessly across the complex, regulated, and mission-critical environment of a hospital? Starting with a small team in Atlanta, we designed every component of our patient engagement ecosystem to be bulletproof yet intuitive. From real-time feedback to portal signups, the platform really is one of a kind, as one administrator at Memorial Hospital Jacksonville told us. My team transformed each bedside tablet into a gateway to education, entertainment, and connection—whether a patient needed to understand their heart disease through interactive 3D visualization or video-call their family during COVID-19 restrictions. Together, we built more than a content delivery system; we created meaningful moments of engagement that measurably improved patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes.

                    Building healthcare technology means building for zero tolerance of failure. When designing the CarePrime architecture, every decision was driven by the reality that our system would be supporting patients during their most vulnerable moments. The team chose a cloud-first approach on Rackspace infrastructure with LUKS-encrypted databases, redundant MySQL systems, and NGINX load balancing because hospitals can't afford downtime. But the real innovation came from our client-side architecture: we developed a comprehensive suite of proprietary Android applications that gave us complete control over thousands of deployed tablets. From remote provisioning to automated content updates, my team built a system where every device could be managed, monitored, and maintained without a technician ever needing to visit the bedside. We created a platform so reliable that nurses and doctors could focus on what they do best: caring for patients.

                    The magic happened when clinical workflow met intuitive technology. Working directly with our in-house physician, we designed features that solved real problems healthcare workers faced every day. Our digital rounding toolkit transformed how nurses conducted their rounds, replacing clipboards with real-time data collection and instant service recovery capabilities. The platform allows for effective service recovery when required by giving staff immediate visibility into patient satisfaction in real-time. Meanwhile, patients could explore our library of 1,500+ educational modules, play interactive games, or use our 3D anatomy reference system to understand their procedures. Every feature was born from countless hours the team spent in hospital halls, watching how technology could either enhance or hinder the sacred relationship between caregiver and patient.

                    Nothing tells the story better than seeing the platform in action. These videos capture years of iteration and refinement, born from feedback from thousands of patient interactions across 80 hospitals and 60 infusion centers. The Anatomy Reference System grew from watching patients struggle to understand complex medical procedures—the team realized that a 3D interactive heart model could communicate what hours of explanation couldn't. Our Infusion Management interface emerged from spending time with cancer patients who wanted to understand their treatment journey. Each demo represents not just technical achievement, but human-centered design solving real problems for people during some of the most challenging moments of their lives.

                <p class="section-subtitle">
                    Every technology choice was intentional, tested under the pressure of healthcare's demanding environment. When building for hospitals, you can't choose trendy frameworks—the team chose battle-tested technologies that would work reliably for years. PHP and MySQL formed our stable backend foundation, while Angular and React gave us the flexibility to create engaging patient interfaces. The Android/Java stack was essential for our custom tablet management system, allowing us to control every aspect of the patient-facing devices. But the real innovation was in how my team made these technologies work together: seamless data flow from bedside tablet to cloud analytics, real-time updates across thousands of devices, and HIPAA-compliant security at every layer. We built not just a technology stack, but a reliability platform that supported some of the most critical moments in people's lives.

                <p class="section-subtitle">
                    My journey from digital artist to healthcare technology executive wasn't traditional, but it gave me a unique perspective on how technology should serve human needs. Starting with a BFA in Digital Photography and advancing to a Master's in Digital Media from Georgia Tech, I learned that great technology isn't about the code—it's about understanding the human experience. I began my career as a graphic designer in the music and set design industry, where I learned the importance of creating experiences that connect emotionally with audiences. At Rival Industries, my team and I served Fortune 500 clients like AT&T and IBM, learning how to build enterprise-grade solutions that scale. But co-founding Bioscape Digital taught me how technology can truly matter. Bioscape Digital's Patient Engagement Platform really has taken our patients' experience to the next level—words like these from healthcare administrators remind me why the Bioscape team and I spent over a decade building not just software, but tools that help heal.

                    I started captaining boats part-time in 2018, balancing it with enterprise healthcare work. Over the years, the water kept calling—by late 2023, I was picking up more and more jobs on tow-boats. In 2024, I leaned into it fully, splitting my time between commercial towing and rediscovering my love for hands-on development. Along the way, I found problems worth solving and curiosities worth exploring. These are passion projects—works in progress where I've been integrating AI into my workflow and building things that interest me.
